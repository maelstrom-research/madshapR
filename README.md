The madshapR package provides functions for efficient data cleaning,
evaluation, and documentation across different datasets. It was
developed to support work at Maelstrom Research and includes functions
to evaluate and summarize datasets and their associated data
dictionaries, identify potential issues in content and structure, and
prepare datasets and metadata for further processing. The key outputs
provided by the functions are formatted datasets, standardized metadata,
and tabular and visual summary reports.
