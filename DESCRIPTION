Description: Functions to support rigorous processes in data cleaning, 
     evaluation, and documentation across datasets from different studies based 
     on Maelstrom Research guidelines. The package includes the core functions 
     to evaluate and format the main inputs that define the process, diagnose 
     errors, and summarize and evaluate datasets and their associated 
     data dictionaries. The main outputs are clean datasets and associated 
     metadata, and tabular and visual summary reports.
