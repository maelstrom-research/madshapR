\title{Create an empty dataset from a data dictionary}
\usage{
data_extract(data_dict, data_dict_apply = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data_dict}{A list of tibble(s) representing meta data of an
associated dataset (to be generated).}

\item{data_dict_apply}{whether to apply the data dictionary to its dataset.
The resulting tibble will have for each column its associated meta data as
attributes. The factors will be preserved. FALSE by default.}
}
\value{
A tibble identifying the dataset created from the variable names list in
'Variables' component of the data dictionary.
}
\description{
Creates an empty dataset using information contained in a data dictionary.
The columns name are the 'name' provided in the 'Variables' tibble of the
data dictionary. If a 'valueType' or alternatively 'typeof' column is
provided, the class of each column is set accordingly (default is text).
}
\details{
A data dictionary-like structure must be a list of at least one or two
data-frame or data-frame extension (e.g. a tibble) named 'Variables'
and 'Categories' (if any), representing meta data of an associated dataset.
The 'Variables' component must contain at least 'name' column and the
'Categories' component must at least contain 'variable' and 'name'
columns to be usable in any function of the package.
To be considered as a minimum (workable) data dictionary, it must also
have unique and non-null entries in 'name' column and the combination
'name'/'variable' must also be unique in 'Categories'.
In addition, the data dictionary may follow Maelstrom research standards,
and its content can be evaluated accordingly, such as naming convention
restriction, columns like 'valueType', 'missing' and 'label(:xx)',
and/or any taxonomy provided.
