\title{Validate and coerce any object as data dictionary in the Maelstrom Research format}
\usage{
as_mlstr_data_dict(object, as_data_dict = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A potential valid data dictionary to be coerced.}

\item{as_data_dict}{Whether the output data dictionary has a simple
data dictionary structure or not (meaning has a Maelstrom data dictionary
structure, compatible with Maelstrom ecosystem such as Opal environment.
FALSE by default.}
}
\value{
A list of tibble(s) identifying a data dictionary.
}
\description{
Confirms that the input object is a valid data dictionary compliant with
Maelstrom Research format, and return it as a taxonomy with the appropriate
mlstr_class attribute. This function mainly helps validate input within other
functions of the package but could be used to check if a taxonomy is valid.
}
\details{
A data dictionary-like structure must be a list of at least one or two
data frame or data frame extension (e.g. a tibble) named 'Variables'
and 'Categories' (if any), representing meta data of an associated dataset.
The 'Variables' component must contain at least 'name' column and the
'Categories' component must at least contain 'variable' and 'name'
columns to be usable in any function of the package.
To be considered as a minimum (workable) data dictionary, it must also
have unique and non-null entries in 'name' column and the combination
'name'/'variable' must also be unique in 'Categories'.
In addition, the data dictionary may follow Maelstrom research stardards,
and its content can be evaluated accordingly, such as naming convention
restriction, columns like 'valueType', 'missing' and 'label(:xx)',
and/or any taxonomy provided.
