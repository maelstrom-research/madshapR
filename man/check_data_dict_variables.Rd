\title{Return non unique variables across a data dictionary}
\usage{
check_data_dict_variables(data_dict)
}
\arguments{
\item{data_dict}{A list of tibble(s) representing meta data to be evaluated.}
}
\value{
A tibble providing non unique variables across a data dictionary.
}
\description{
Generates a tibble that reports any variable whose name is not
unique across the list of variable names in the 'Variables' sheet.
This tibble can be used to assist the user in the assessment of the dataset
structure, fields investigation (mandatory or not), coherence across elements
and taxonomy or standard evaluation.
}
\details{
A data dictionary-like structure must be a list of at least one or two
data-frame or data-frame extension (e.g. a tibble) named 'Variables'
and 'Categories' (if any), representing meta data of an associated dataset.
The 'Variables' component must contain at least 'name' column and the
'Categories' component must at least contain 'variable' and 'name'
columns to be usable in any function of the package.
To be considered as a minimum (workable) data dictionary, it must also
have unique and non-null entries in 'name' column and the combination
'name'/'variable' must also be unique in 'Categories'.
In addition, the data dictionary may follow Maelstrom research standards,
and its content can be evaluated accordingly, such as naming convention
restriction, columns like 'valueType', 'missing' and 'label(:xx)',
and/or any taxonomy provided.
