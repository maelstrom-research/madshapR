\title{Return values which valueType differs between data and their data dictionary}
\usage{
check_dataset_valueType(data, data_dict = NULL, valueType_guess = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A tibble identifying the input data observations.}

\item{data_dict}{A list of tibble(s) representing meta data to be evaluated.}

\item{valueType_guess}{Whether the output should include a more accurate
valueType that could be applied to the dataset. TRUE by default.}
}
\value{
A tibble providing values which valueType differs between data and
their data dictionary.
}
\description{
Generates a tibble that reports any valueType differing
between data observation and their data dictionary declaration.
This tibble can be used to assist the user in the assessment of the data
structure, fields investigation (mandatory or not), coherence across elements
and taxonomy or standard evaluation.
}
\details{
A data dictionary-like structure must be a list of at least one or two
data frame or data frame extension (e.g. a tibble) named 'Variables'
and 'Categories' (if any), representing meta data of an associated dataset.
The 'Variables' component must contain at least 'name' column and the
'Categories' component must at least contain 'variable' and 'name'
columns to be usable in any function of the package.
To be considered as a minimum (workable) data dictionary, it must also
have unique and non-null entries in 'name' column and the combination
'name'/'variable' must also be unique in 'Categories'.
In addition, the data dictionary may follow Maelstrom research standards,
and its content can be evaluated accordingly, such as naming convention
restriction, columns like 'valueType', 'missing' and 'label(:xx)',
and/or any taxonomy provided.

A dataset must be a data frame or data frame extension (e.g. a tibble) and
can be associated to a data dictionary. If not, a minimum workable data
dictionary can always be generated, when any column will be reported, and
any factor column will be analysed as categorical variable (the column
'levels' will be created for that. In addition, the dataset may follow
Maelstrom research standards, and its content can be evaluated accordingly,
such as naming convention restriction, or id columns declaration (which
full completeness is mandatory.
