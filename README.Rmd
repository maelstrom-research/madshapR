Functions to support data cleaning, evaluation, and description, 
developed for integration with Maelstrom Research software tools. 'madshapR' 
provides functions primarily to evaluate and manipulate datasets and 
data dictionaries in preparation for data harmonization with the package 
'Rmonize' and to facilitate integration and transfer between RStudio servers 
and secure Opal environments. 'madshapR' functions can be used independently
but are optimized in conjunction with ‘Rmonize’ functions for streamlined 
and coherent harmonization processing.
