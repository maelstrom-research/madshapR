The goal of madshapR is to provide functions to support rigorous processes in 
data cleaning, evaluation, and documentation across datasets from different 
studies based on Maelstrom Research guidelines. The package includes the core 
functions to evaluate and format the main inputs that define the process, 
diagnose errors, and summarize and evaluate datasets and their associated 
data dictionaries. The main outputs are clean datasets and associated metadata, 
and tabular and visual summary reports.
